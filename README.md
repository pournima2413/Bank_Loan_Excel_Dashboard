# 🏦 Bank Loan Risk & Performance Analytics Dashboard

An interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes bank loan portfolio performance, repayment trends, and credit risk using KPIs and visual analytics to support data-driven lending decisions.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
Banks receive thousands of loan applications and maintain large volumes of financial data including loan amount, interest rate, borrower income, and repayment history.  
However, raw data alone does not help management understand whether the bank is growing safely or taking high risk.

This project builds a **complete reporting system in Excel** to monitor:

- Loan performance
- Repayment behavior
- Borrower risk
- Lending trends

The dashboard transforms raw banking data into meaningful insights for decision making.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Banks struggle to quickly evaluate loan portfolio health because data is scattered across multiple records.  
Managers cannot easily identify risky loans, repayment trends, or monthly performance changes.

This dashboard provides a **single source of truth** that allows stakeholders to monitor lending activity and detect potential risks early.
